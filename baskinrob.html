      Baskin Robbins Rebranding Project. 
      The new brand identity mixes designs that simultaneously give both a modern and vintage feel, intended to appeal to the younger generation while still maintaining familiarity for longtime customers. 
    </p>
    <p>Two iconic pink spoons form the initials of Baskin Robbins in the new logo.
      The challenge was to create a logo that is minimalistic but still features two things: the two spoons and the number “31” The gradient highlights the number “31” which can be read when the letter “B” and “R” come together. 
      The multiplicity in spoons implies the meaning of sharing and community, putting emphasis on the playful and social characteristics that the brand has. The slight irregularity and asymmetry in the curvilinear letterforms support the brand to feel more approachable and welcoming.
