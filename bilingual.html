    <p>Designed a typeface that incorporates traditional Korean brush serifs with English letters.</p>
    
    <p>The idea for this typeface stemmed from a personal memory of learning how to write Korean as a kid. Copying directly off of the exemplaries
       on the practice sheets, I developed a habit of including the brush serifs in my hand writing. The order in which the strokes are made to write 
       the characters determine the look of the serifs, and I experimented with applying that idea to english letters and creating a step by step system 
       of which the letters can be written using strokes. </p>
